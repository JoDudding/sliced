Exploring the data used for Sliced.  See the html version of this page [here](https://jodudding.github.io/sliced/).

[SLICED](https://harsh-walleye-e6e.notion.site/SLICED-Show-c7bd26356e3a42279e2dfbafb0480073) is like the TV Show Chopped but for data science. Competitors get a never-before-seen dataset and two-hours to code a solution to a prediction challenge. Contestants get points for the best model plus bonus points for data visualization, votes from the audience, and more.

Here are a couple of articles about it:

- [Three reasons to watch #SLICED: A real time data science competition](https://medium.com/data-science/three-reasons-to-watch-sliced-a-real-time-data-science-competition-8d5212ccf988)
- [Data Science Coding Meets Esports](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-coding-meets-esports-9439d3ecf91e/)

This repo is my attempt to build some models used the SLICED datasets.
